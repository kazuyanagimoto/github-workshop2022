## Why Do People Use Git?

<br>

#### üìù **Recording**

take logs of all coding activity of you and your collaborators

#### üïí **Restorable**

go back to a previous version of codes

#### üîç **Comparable**

focus on the change in the codes, and detect bugs

#### üîÄ **Branch**

separate things completed and under development



## Is Git Easy?

<br>

### No. I am sorry.
- Git has many commands with many options
- Need some knowledge to recover from a trouble
- Git allows various styles to use, which are different across people and organization

<br>

### I propose
- First follow my workflow, which requires the minimum knowledge
- Once you're comfortable with it, learn the detail


## Is GitHub Git?

<br>

:::: {.columns}

### Git Is a Version Control Tool
- Command Line App
- Works in a local machine

<br>

### GitHub Is a Web-Service
- Publish Codes
- Collaboration

## CUI vs GUI?

<br>

#### GUI Applications for Git & GitHub

- We are going to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Other options: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Fork](https://git-fork.com/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

<br>

#### I recommend to learn CUI first

- CUI knowledge is necessary to use GUI
- Some troubles can be solved only through command line
- DVC (explained later) only works with command line


# Basics of Git

## Commit Is a Save Point!

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_history.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

- "The purpose of Git" is to create a **COMMIT**
- A commit is a save point of a state of the project folder

## You Can _Go Back_ to Any Commit

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_back.svg){fig-align="center"}




## You Can _Compare_ Any Two Commits

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_compare.svg){fig-align="center"}

## What Is _Commit_ in a Computer?

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_commit.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

- If you init a git project on a folder, a _hidden_ folder `.git` will be made
- When you create a commit, the state of the folder will be stored in `.git` folder
- The name of commit is just a random hash string



## Local & Remote Repository

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_repository.svg){fig-align="center"}

- `.git` folder in your local machine (like in the previous page) is called **local repository**
- Usually, a **remote repository** (like GitHub) is used for code sharing
- **Push** and **Pull** is a command to sync your local repository with the remote  repository


# CUI and GUI Operations

## Stage

- When you modify some files, you can create a commit only for specific changes
- This choosing process is called, **Staging**

#### Command Line

<br>

```shell
git add foo1.txt
```

<br>

#### VS Code

## Commit

- You have to add a message for each commit

#### Command Line

<br>

```shell
git commit -m "YOUR COMMENT"
```

<br>

#### VS Code



## Push and Pull

For now, forget about `origin main`

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

### Push

#### Command Line

```shell
git push origin main
```

<br>

#### VS Code

:::

::: {.column}
### Pull

#### Command Line

```shell
git push origin main
```

<br>

#### VS Code

## Handson 1: First Commit and Push

<br>

### 1. Go to [GitHub webpage](https://github.com/) and create a repository
1. Choose the private repository (if it is for research)
1. Choose the language you are using for .gitignore
1. Add README
1. No need to choose license (because it is private)

<br>

### 2. Clone it to your local machine
1. The easist way is to open a new window of VS Code and choose "clone a repository"
1. You can also do `git clone URL_OF_REPOSITORY`

## {}
### 3. Create a Commit and Push it
1. Create a text file (say foo1.txt) with a random text (say "Hello Git!")
1. Create a commit (don't forget to stage it before)
1. Push to the remote repository

# Branch, Merge, and Conflict

## HEAD and Branch

- **Branch**: a label of a commit
- **HEAD**: the branch you are seeing

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_branch.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

- To create a branch, `git branch BRANCH_NAME`
- To move the HEAD, `git switch BRANCH_NAME`

## Merge

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_merge.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

- You can merge a branche into HEAD by `git merge BRANCH_NAME`


## 1. Merge at Local Repository

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_local_merge.svg){fig-align="center"}

- Merge it to main on your local repository
- Push the local main into the remote main
- You can use it for solo project

  
## 2. Merge at Remote Repository

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_remote_merge.svg){fig-align="center"}

- Create a **Pull Request** on GitHub Repository
- Decide to merge it into main or not on GitHub
- Used for collaboration (but I use it even for solo project)



## Questions about Branches

<br>

#### *Why Do We Use Branch?*
- Keep **main** branch clean and work correctly
- Easy to detect a bug (because "main" works perfectly)
- Collaborators create a branch from main and work on it

<br>

#### *When Should I Create a Branch?*
A simple suggestion is _main-dev workflow_

- You only work on **dev** branch (with a collaborator, I use my name for the developing branch)
- When you finish a meaningful chunk of works, cleanup uneccessary files and merge **dev** into **main**

I usually merge _dev_ into _main_ just before the meeting with my supervisor or collaborators.


## Conflict

A different code is written in the same line of two branches in merging

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

![](./public/drawio/git_conflict.svg){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column}

#### Produced File

<br>

```shell
aaaaa
bbbbb
<<<<<<< HEAD
cccccc
======
zzzzzz
>>>>>>> dev
ddddd
```

:::
::::

<br>

Most conflicts can be avoided by a rule prohibitting members from co-editting the same file


## Solve a Conflict

1. Delete the lines you don't need and save the file
1. Create a commit for this merge and solving the conflict

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

### Regular Editor

```shell
aaaaa
bbbbb
<<<<<<< HEAD
cccccc
======
zzzzzz
>>>>>>> dev
ddddd
```
$$\Downarrow$$

```shell
aaaaa
bbbbb
zzzzz
ddddd
```

::: {.column}

## Pull = Fetch + Merge

<br>

![](./public/drawio/git_pull.svg){fig-align="center"}

- **Fetch** : download a branch from the remote repository (origin) to a local machine, named `origin/BRANCH_NAME`
- `git pull origin main` is equivalent to `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`
- Because it is a merge, `git pull` could return a CONFLICT!



## Handson 2: Two Types of Merge

<br>

### 1. Local Merge
1. Create a new branch "dev" and switch the HEAD into it
1. Create some commits
1. Switch HEAD into main
1. Merge dev into main
1. Push it to origin/main
1. Delete (local) dev branch


## {}
### 2. Remote Merge
1. Create dev branch and switch into it
1. Create some commits
1. Push it to origin/dev
1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
1. Merge it into main and delete the remote dev branch
1. Go back to local and switch into main
1. Pull main branch and delete (local) dev branch


## Handson 3: Three Types of Conflicts

### 1. Local Conflict

1. Switch to dev and create `foo1.txt` with a line of text (e.g. "Tortilla sin Cebolla") and create a commit
1. Switch to main and create `foo1.txt` with a different line of text (e.g. "Tortilla con Cebolla") and a create a commit
1. Merge dev into main, which produces a conflict
1. Solve the conflict by choosing either of the lines

### 2. Pull Request Conflict

1. Head on main and create `foo2txt` with a line of text (e.g. "Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor's new clothes! "). Push it into origin/main
1. Switch to dev and create `foo2.txt` with a different line of text (e.g. "But the Emperor has nothing at all on!"). Push it into origin/dev
1. Go to GitHub and create a pull request. Solve the conflict on GitHub

## {}
### 3. Pull Conflict

1. Switch to dev and create `foo3.txt` with a line of text (e.g. "Mountain of Mushroom"), create a commit, and push into origin/dev
1. Go to GitHub and merge dev into main
1. Go back to local. Switch to main and create `foo3.txt` with a different line of text (e.g. "Mountain of Bumbooshoot"), create a commit
1. Pull from origin/main, which produces a conflict. Solve it.

# Git & GitHub Workflow


## 1. Sync Local Repository

<br>

![](./public/drawio/wf_pull.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

```shell
git switch main
git pull origin main
```

## 2. Write Your Codes on Dev branch

<br>

![](./public/drawio/wf_branch.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

#### 1. Switch to a new developing branch

```shell
git branch dev
git switch dev
```

Or

```shell
git checkout -b "dev"
```

<br>

#### 2. Write your codes





## 3. Commit

<br>

![](./public/drawio/wf_commit.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

#### 1. Stage files you want to commit

```shell
git add foo1.txt foo2.txt
```

If you want to stage all modified files, `git add .`

<br>

#### 2. Commit

```shell
git commit -m "hogehoge"
```


## 4. Push to the Remote Repository

<br>

![](./public/drawio/wf_push.svg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

```shell
git push origin dev
```


## 5. Pull Request and Merge

<br>
<br>
<br>

![](./public/drawio/wf_pr.svg){fig-align="center"}


<br>

I recommend you to delete the remote and local dev branch here.


## Handson 4: Follow My Workflow

<br>

- Follow my workflow 1-5 with a few commits
- Try both command line and VS Code


# GitHub with Data



## Data Version Control (DVC)

<br>

#### *How Can We Work with Data in Git?*
- We want to store the data in the Git project (because referred in the code)
- Not interested in change in each line of the data (imagine data cleaning)
- There is a limit for the file size in GitHub (100 MB)

<br>


#### *How Does DVC Work?*
- Create a text file for the meta-information of the data
- Git manages only the text file
- Git can follow when the data is added, modified, deleted through the text file
- The original data is stored in the remote storage (Google Drive, Amazon S3, ..)



## How Does DVC Work?

<br>

![](./public/drawio/dvc.svg){fig-align="center"}



## {}

### Setup Commands

#### 1. Init a DVC project

```shell
dvc init
```

#### 2. Setup the remote DVC Repository (Google Drive)

- Create a new Google drive folder and copy the folder id from its URL
- Run the follwoing

```shell
dvc remote add --default myremote gdrive://GDRIVE_FOLDER_CODE
```

<br>

### Workflow Commands
#### 1. Track a file by DVC

```shell
dvc add foo1.csv
```

You can specify a folder (e.g. data) with *-R* option ```dvc add -R data```

#### 2. Push data to the remote storage

```shell
dvc push
```

#### 3. Pull data from the remote storage

```shell
dvc pull
```

## Handson 5: Setup DVC and Follow My Workflow

<br>

1. Init a DVC project and setup its remote on Google Drive
1. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/nicetak/github-workshop2022) of this workshop and read my workflow
1. In step 2, add a csv file in `data/csv` folder and create a commit (say, "add foo1.csv")
1. Follow the rest of my workflow


## Troubleshoot

<br>

#### Git Reference log
You can see all the git activity (commit, merge, rebase, ...)

```shell
git reflog
```

<br>

#### Git Reset
You can reset any git activity

```shell
git reset --soft COMMIT_ID_OR_REFLOG_ID
```

<br>

### Keep in Mind
- Nothing bad happens with Git. It just stores savepoints.
- In practice, you rarely restore a file from a commit. But it gives you a lot of relief and freedom.
